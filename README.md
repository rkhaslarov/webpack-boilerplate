Webpack 3 Boilerplate
===========

## Requirements
You only need <b>node.js</b> pre-installed and youâ€™re good to go.

$ npm install
```

## Development
Run the local webpack-dev-server with livereload and autocompile on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
```sh
$ npm start
```
## Deployment
Build the current application
```sh
$ npm run build
```

## [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
If you're not familiar with webpack, the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) will serve the static files in your build folder and watch your source files for changes.
